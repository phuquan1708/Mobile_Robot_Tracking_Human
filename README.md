# Mobile_Robot_Tracking_Human
My collages and I at Hanoi University of Industry developed a project focused on a mobile robot capable of following a human using Digital Image Processing, specifically leveraging YOLO v4. The robot utilizes a camera mounted on it to detect and track the position of a person, enabling it to follow them autonomously.
